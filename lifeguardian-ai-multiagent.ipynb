    "\n",
    "###  **Purpose**\n",
    "The **Behavior Monitor Agent** continuously observes the user's digital patterns to detect **early warning signs** of risk.  \n",
    "This agent helps identify subtle danger indicators through behavior tracking such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sleep patterns  \n",
    "- Study/work duration  \n",
    "- Stress indicators in messages  \n",
    "- Doom-scrolling or isolation tendencies  \n",
    "- Productivity fluctuations  \n",
    "- Irregular routines and burnout signals  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is one of the *most critical* agents in LifeGuardian AI because it tracks long-term patterns that other agents cannot see.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Core Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "####  **1. Continuous Monitoring (Loop Agent)**\n",
    "Runs in intervals to analyze behavior patterns **repeatedly** rather than just once.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  **2. Memory Bank (Long-Term Pattern Storage)**\n",
    "Uses a JSON-based memory store to keep track of:\n",
    "- Daily activity logs  \n",
    "- Sleep cycles  \n",
    "- Sentiment history  \n",
    "- Work hours  \n",
    "- Stress words detected  \n",
    "\n",
    "This helps the agent detect **trend-based risks**, not just momentary spikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Risk Signal Detection**\n",
    "The agent flags potential danger signs such as:\n",
    "- Burnout risk  \n",
    "- Productivity drop  \n",
    "- Abnormal screen time  \n",
    "- Late-night activity  \n",
    "- Emotional stress through negative sentiment  \n",
    "- Isolation from reduced communication frequency  \n",
    "\n",
    "Uses both **numerical scores + sentiment analysis** to calculate risk.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Purpose**\n",
    "The **Risk Detection Agent** analyzes the behavioral data collected by the Behavior Monitor Agent and identifies multiple types of risk **simultaneously**.  \n",
    "It evaluates real-world danger categories such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mental health risk** → stress, negative sentiment, emotional disturbance  \n",
    "- **Burnout risk** → excessive work/study hours, no breaks  \n",
    "- **Scam / digital safety risk** → suspicious links, unknown senders  \n",
    "- **Physical health risk** → irregular sleep cycles, late-night activity  \n",
    "- **Social isolation risk** → reduced interactions, lack of communication  \n",
    "\n",
    "This allows LifeGuardian AI to detect **multi-dimensional risk patterns** at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  **Core Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "####  **1. Parallel Risk Evaluation**\n",
    "Uses parallel processing to analyze multiple risk types **at the same time**, improving speed and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Code Execution Tool**\n",
    "Each risk evaluation uses custom scoring algorithms that calculate:\n",
    "- Frequency patterns  \n",
    "- Variations in behavior  \n",
    "- Sudden spikes in unhealthy activities  \n",
    "\n",
    "####  **3. Structured Output**\n",
    "The agent produces:\n",
    "- A **risk score** for each category (0–100)  \n",
    "- A **classified severity level**  \n",
    "- A **summary alert message**  \n",
    "\n",
    "This output flows directly into the Context Understanding Agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "###  **Libraries Used**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Library | Purpose |\n",
    "|--------|---------|\n",
    "| **pandas** | Reads user behavior data from memory |\n",
    "| **numpy** | Performs statistical and numerical calculations |\n",
    "| **concurrent.futures** | Runs all risk detection tasks in parallel |\n",
    "| **IPython.display** | Displays clear alerts inside Kaggle Notebook |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "###  **Instructions for Kaggle Notebook**\n",

    "- `pandas` → pre-installed  \n",
    "- `numpy` → pre-installed  \n",
    "- `concurrent.futures` → built into Python  \n",
    "- `IPython.display` → pre-installed  \n",
    "\n",
    "####  Important:\n",
    "Make sure the file **`behavior_memory.json`** (created by the Behavior Monitor Agent) exists before running this agent.  \n",
    "This file contains all the user behavior history needed for risk analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Outcome**\n",
    "\n",
    "This agent gives LifeGuardian AI the ability to:\n",
    "- Detect multiple risk categories in **parallel**  \n",
    "- Quantify risk with clear numerical values  \n",
    "- Pick up hidden patterns indicating early danger  \n",
    "- Provide a structured risk profile to other agents  \n",
    "\n",
    "It forms the **core intelligence layer** of the entire system.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Detects Critical Risk Levels  \n",
    "   - Monitors if any risk category repeatedly crosses a critical threshold (e.g., above 80/100).  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Initiates Emergency Protocols (Demo-Friendly)  \n",

    "3. Works After the Guardian Action Agent  \n",
    "   - Activated only when all previous interventions fail to bring the risk down.  \n",

    "4. Prevents Escalation  \n",
    "   - Stops harmful behavior loops such as overworking, unsafe digital interactions, or severe mental stress indicators.  \n",

    "---\n",

    "   - Uses a Memory Bank to detect patterns of repeated high-risk scores.  \n",
    "   - Escalates only when dangerous patterns persist across sessions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Severity-Based Response  \n",
    "   - Mild: Shows warning alerts  \n",
    "   - Medium: Strong recommendations for action  \n",
    "   - Critical: Triggers emergency escalation  \n",
